# Project #2 Proposal

### Assignment

Now that you have seen some use cases for WebSockets, think about what you would do with it. Try to come up with a proposal as detailed as possible. Who is it for? How does it work? What technologies — third-party APIs, mobile, NodeJS modules, etc — do you need? Does it require a database? What is the data model?
