# Project #1

### Assignment

Build a data-driven web application. Your project must:

* At least READ data from an external source â€” Parse, a JSON file, or whatever you feel more comfortable with.
* Have no less than 2 different "screens." If you're building a canvas-based game, maybe you have 2 scenes? If it's a dynamic html website, 2 pages. If it's a datavis, 2 charts or 2 ways of visualizing the same data and so on.
* Respond to user interaction.
