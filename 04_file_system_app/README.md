# File System App

### Assignment

Create an app that interacts with the file system. No user input required, but that might make things more interesting. As usual, try to match this with your personal interests. Maybe you want to visualize your files/file structure? Or create a game that permanently deletes your files? Or make an OS-like website?  
**Bonus:** as usual, *make it interact with an API*.
